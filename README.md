# TradePro_Reimagined

Trade Pro reimagined is a django web app deployed in a containerized state on Kubernetes via Digital Oceans. CI/CD via Github Actions to automate pushing updates to the cloud. This is a project that I originally helped create for a group project in school that was made in Java/ JavaFX locally. The end goal is to have a social platform to share your investment portfolio with friends, and also get investment advice from the apps algorithms. 

## Objective

Gain experience with a number of technologies including django, react, docker, Kubernetes, linux, Github Actions, Digital Oceans
